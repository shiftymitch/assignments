Welcome to my Projects site.

This site will be a home to my class projects. 

The layout of the site uses Bootstrap cards as Project placeholders. Currently there are no live projects on the site, just template cards to see how the projects will appear.

Each project card will include: 
1. A screenshot of the project.
2. A Title.
3. A quick description.
4. Links to view the project, and share the project. 

TO-DO:
1. Currently, card share buttons do have any functionality, but I intend to write some javascript to enable social media sharing.
2. The last card in the list will be a "+" button to add a new card. This button will be a javascript function to build a new div using template settings from a template card.
